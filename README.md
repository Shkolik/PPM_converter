# PPM_converter
Convert and/or extend PPM signal to comunicate with TX from other vendor.

Original idea was pair old Hitec Flash5 TX with Spektrum DX6i. They both have trainer port, but use different channels order and count.
Using this code and Arduino for me is the simpliest way to do this job and add 3 channels to old radio, that give it new live.

Code compatible with Arduino Nano\Pro Micro, generic ATmega 328p or ATmega16(L) with 16MHz or 8MHz freq.

Feel free to contribute or submit issues.

TO-DO:
- Add custom channels
- Test with multiprotocol module
