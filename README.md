# PPM_converter
Convert and/or extend PPM signal to comunicate with TX from other vendor.

Original idea was pair old Hitec Flash5 TX with Spektrum DX6i. They both have trainer port, but use different channels order and count.
Using this code and Arduino for me is the simpliest way to do this job and add 3 channels to old radio, that give it new live.

Feel free to contribute or submit issues.

TO-DO:
- Fix channels ordering
- Fix jitter when reading. Have to calculate correction time
